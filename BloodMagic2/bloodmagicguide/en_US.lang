# Architect Entry Texts
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.intro.1=My name is Tiberius. I was a kid when the demons came for my village during The Wars. They ransacked the houses and turned the shacks into splinters, wielding fire and water to blast the land asunder. I woke up to some travelling merchants that were passing by, equipping the warriors who were futily trying to drive off the demons that still clawed the village. I was brought to a village nearby, where a magician named Magus helped tend to my wounds. The magic that he used was something that I had never seen before - it wasn't Thaumaturgy, nor Alchemy, and it was definitely not Botany. He winked at me once he saw that my eyes were open, holding his finger to his lips. Fast-forward several years, and I have learned almost everything from Master Magus, being his third student ever to master his arts. Against his wishes, I have recorded my research and put several wards and spells on this book. So welcome, apprentice. I am known as The Architect, and I am a Blood Mage. It took several years of pestering before I managed to convince Magus to teach me. He kept on telling me that, "Magic that uses the life essence of living beings requires patience and preparation in order to master it. One false move, go a little past your natural endurance, and you may find yourself taking a nice vacation in Tartarus." The thing was, I wanted to go there - I had some unfinished business with the demons. The process that Magus originally constructed required powerful artifacts that he constructed himself, but were rather lacking where teaching was concerned. After studying a bit of alchemy and the process of "Equivalent Exchange," I managed to construct myself an altar that would transmute items inside of its basin into new powerful forms. The only issue was that it needed a worthy catalyst, and so with a prick of the finger I set the Blood Altar alight!
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.bloodAltar.1=To start any form of transmutation involving blood, you would need to construct a blood altar and a sacrificial knife, as well as have a solitary diamond in your possession. After placing the blood altar down, Magus advised me to be careful as I filled it slowly with my blood, and said that I would need to be really close to the altar (about a metre) for the knife to work. With about 2 buckets of blood in the altar, which Master Magus reminds me is about 10 hearts worth, I placed the diamond inside of the altar by activating it with the diamond in hand.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.bloodAltar.2=The blood dissipated in a cloud of red swirls as I waited for the atoms of the diamond to shift and reform. There were a few moments where the particles turned gray, which meant that the altar was empty and I had to hurry to fill it. After the diamond burst in a shower of red particles, what finally sat in the altar was a Weak Blood Orb.

# Demon Kin Entry Texts
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.intro.info=My name is Bella Highborn, and I am known as the Demon Kin. Several months ago my village was attacked by a wave of demons, killing all other people while destroying every single building. I don't remember much from the attack, other than the screams of pain as each and every person I knew left this world for a happier one. Thankfully the demons did not hear me as I cowered underneath the fruit baskets in the basement of the church of Intactilis, trying desperately to keep my screams from joining the chorus of other voices. \nThere was one horrible moment when I accidentally knocked down the incense altar of the church and a demon came bounding into the sanctuary, unperturbed by what we assumed was a sacred place. It was a huge four-legged monster, with curved tusks hanging past a jutting mouth, saliva dripping onto serrated swords taking the place of his claws. It took a look around the room and I swear it locked eyes with me for a solid second, but then it just simply left as if it neither heard nor saw anything. Everything afterwards was a blur. \nIt was a full day before anyone came to see what happened. A trading caravan saw the smoke in the distance and decided to take the long way around past the demons. Many of the traders didn't even want to look at me, fearing that because I alone managed to survive unscathed it was a bad omen. But two brothers decided to take pity on me and try to convince the rest of the caravan to consider having me ride along. It took me selling the priestess's wand and locket, but I managed to buy safe passage to a village far enough away from the demons' path of destruction.
